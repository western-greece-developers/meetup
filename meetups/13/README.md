## Workshop ideas

- Startup in fast forward
  We build a project from scratch working in an agile way but in a 10x speed. We start with a quick planning meeting (10 mins max) and we distribute tasks to pairs. We work for 1 - 2 hours and then we integrate the work in another 30 minutes.

  Purpose: Work on our pair programming skills and build a useful app.

- Issue killing spree
  We pick an open source project (or multiple) and work in pairs. We try to solve as many issues as possible (e.g. GitHub issues) in 2 hours. In the end we present our achievements.

  Purpose: Work on our pair programming skills, learn from other people's code, contribute to upstream open source projects.

- Community friendly development
  We split in pairs and we randomly distribute projects (from a pool of easy to grasp project ideas). Each pair works on the project for 30 minutes and then the projects rotate. Each pair should make sure they hand over all the needed information to the next pair with minimum physical interaction needed.

  Purpose: Work on our pair programming skills and learn to work in a community friendly way (with READMEs, public issues etc).

- ASP.Net Core 2 Simple CRUD Web App
  In teams or solo, create a **asynchronous** web api in a language (C#) that is probably new to many people. (@zarkopafilis)
